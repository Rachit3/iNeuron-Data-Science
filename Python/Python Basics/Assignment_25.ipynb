        "**Ans:** A generator function uses a `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement. A generator function will always return a iterable object called generator. where as a normal function can return a `string/list/tuple/dict/NoneType` ... etc"

        "#### 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
        "**Ans:**The yield statement is used in Python to define a generator that can produce a sequence of values on-the-fly, one at a time, without needing to store all the values in memory at once. It is useful for generating large or infinite sequences, or for generating sequences that require significant computation or I/O operations, and allows for the separation of the generation of values from their use or processing.."
