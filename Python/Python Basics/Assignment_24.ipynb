        "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
        "**Ans:** `def` statements and lambda expressions is that a def statement creates a named function that can be called multiple times, while a `lambda `expression creates an anonymous function that is typically used only once, in the context where it is defined."

        "sequence. \n",
