    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms and models to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It works by training models on labeled or unlabeled data, optimizing their performance, and then applying the learned knowledge to new data. Two machine learning applications in the business world are:\n",

Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",
