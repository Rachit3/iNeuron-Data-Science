One way to put it into action is to start with a small labeled dataset, train a model, and then use active learning techniques to select informative instances for labeling and gradually expand the labeled dataset."

Novelty detection, on the other hand, aims to identify instances that differ from the training data but are not necessarily considered as anomalies.
