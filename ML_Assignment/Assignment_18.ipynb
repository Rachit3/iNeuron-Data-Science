    "**Ans:** Supervised learning uses labeled data to train a model, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. For example, in supervised learning, you can train a model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on labeled examples. In unsupervised learning, you can group similar customer profiles together based on their purchasing behavior without prior labels."
