    "1. Feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) involves learning relevant patterns or features from input images. Convolutional layers use learnable filters to scan the input, capturing local patterns like edges, textures, or shapes. These features are progressively extracted through multiple convolutional layers, and higher-level features representing complex patterns are learned in deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In computer vision tasks, backpropagation works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases) and updating these parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss. During backpropagation, gradients are propagated backward from the output layer to the input layer, allowing the model to learn to adjust its weights and improve its performance.\n",
